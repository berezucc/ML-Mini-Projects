PART 1: basic linear regression
The goal is to predict the profit of a restaurant, based on the number of habitants where the restaurant 
is located. The chain already has several restaurants in different cities. Your goal is to model 
the relationship between the profit and the populations from the cities where they are located.

PART 2: logistic regression 
You are a recruiter and your goal is to predict whether an applicant is likely to get hired or rejected. 
You have gathered data over the years that you intend to use as a training set. 
Your task is to use logistic regression to build a model that predicts whether an applicant is likely to
be hired or not, based on the results of a first round of interview (which consisted of two technical questions).
The training instances consist of the two exam scores of each applicant, as well as the hiring decision.

PART 3: Multi-class classification using logistic regression 
Not all classification algorithms can support multi-class classification (classification tasks with more than two classes).
Logistic Regression was designed for binary classification.
One approach to alleviate this shortcoming, is to split the dataset into multiple binary classification datasets 
and fit a binary classification model on each. 
Two different examples of this approach are the One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One strategies.
"""

#  One-vs-Rest method (a.k.a. One-vs-All)

# Explain below how the One-vs-Rest method works for multi-class classification # 12 points
"""
One-vs-Rest for multi-class classification takes a multi-class problem (more than 2 classes) and splits them into multiple binary classification problems. For every single class, it will train a classifier separately to distinguish the class from all other classes combined. 
At the time of prediction, all the classifiers give a score and the class corresponding to the highest score is chosen for the final prediction. 

An example of binary classification splitting for classes 'red', 'blue', and 'green' would be:
Split 1: Classifier for red & [blue, green]
Split 2: Classifier for blue & [red, green]
Split 3: Classifier for green & [red, green]

OvR is simple to implement and works fine for problems with a smaller number of classes but may struggle with imbalanced datasets if one class has much fewer samples than the others. 
"""

# Explain below how the One-Vs-One method works for multi-class classification # 11 points

"""
One-vs-One designs a classifier for every different class pair from the dataset. Each of them will be trained to distinguish between two specified classes, and a new instance is put before all these classifiers. 
Essentially, a dataset is split into each class versus every other class. The class that gets the maximum vote from all the classifiers is predicted as the final output (majority voting). 

An example of binary classification for classes 'red', 'blue', and 'green' would be:
Split 1: Classifier for red vs blue
Split 2: Classifier for red vs green
Split 3: Classifier for blue vs green

Although the OvO technique can deal with overlapping classes very well, it is not computationally effective. A dataset with large number of classes could be problematic as a distinct model needs to be created for each class.
With many classes comes a large number of models and the need to evaluate each instance multiple times during prediction
