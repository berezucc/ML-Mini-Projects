PART 1: basic linear regression
The goal is to predict the profit of a restaurant, based on the number of habitants where the restaurant 
is located. The chain already has several restaurants in different cities. Your goal is to model 
the relationship between the profit and the populations from the cities where they are located.

# You will notice that there are several instances (rows), of 2 features (columns). 
# The values to be predicted are reported in the 2nd column.

# Load the data from the file RegressionData.csv in a pandas dataframe. Make sure all the instances 
# are imported properly. Name the first feature 'X' and the second feature 'y' (these are the labels)

"""
PART 2: logistic regression 
You are a recruiter and your goal is to predict whether an applicant is likely to get hired or rejected. 
You have gathered data over the years that you intend to use as a training set. 
Your task is to use logistic regression to build a model that predicts whether an applicant is likely to
be hired or not, based on the results of a first round of interview (which consisted of two technical questions).
The training instances consist of the two exam scores of each applicant, as well as the hiring decision.

PART 3: Multi-class classification using logistic regression 
Not all classification algorithms can support multi-class classification (classification tasks with more than two classes).
Logistic Regression was designed for binary classification.
One approach to alleviate this shortcoming, is to split the dataset into multiple binary classification datasets 
and fit a binary classification model on each. 
Two different examples of this approach are the One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One strategies.
